    "## Numerical Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in physics, we will want to calculate the integral of a function, which can be interpreted at the area under the curve of the function between a starting point and and ending point, as illustrated here:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resource/asnlib/public/integral.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike taking a derivative, calculating the analytical form of a derivative is not always easy, and is not even guaranteed to have an analytical closed form! This is one of the reasons it is useful to calculate integrals numerically, know as Numerical Integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discretisation\n",
    "\n",
    "As is the case for any calculation in a computer, the first step is to break our continuous variable $x$ into list of numbers `x[i]` separated by (typically) fixed steps (know as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization>discretising</a>), along with corresponding set of $y$ values $y[i]$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resource/asnlib/public/discrete.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will name the spacing between the steps in $\\Delta x = h$. The example above would correspond to a total number of points $n = 4$, and following the python convention of counting from zero, the last point is then `y[3]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we can use several different approximations to calculate the integrated area, a few of which we will describe here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple sum\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest is to simply sum up all the `y[i]` values except the last and then multiply this by the spacing $h$. For a total number of points $n$, this results in an estimate of the integral $I_{sum}$ given by: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_{\\rm sum} = h \\sum_{i=0}^{n-2} y_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to the following area graphically as an approximation of the continuous integral: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resource/asnlib/public/simple_sum.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the sum limit in the formula above **does not** include the last point ($i = n-1$), but instead stops at second-to-last point ($i=n-2$). This is because for $n$ points, there are $n-1$ blocks (\"slices\") between the first and the last points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trapezoidal rule\n",
    "\n",
    "An obvious improvement over the sum rule above is to replace the \"flat tops\" of the boxes above with sloped lines that connect one point to the next:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resource/asnlib/public/trapezoid_rule.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the Trapezoidal rule: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule\n",
    "\n",
    "We can already see that this is giving a much better approximation! The formula for the estimated integral using the trapezoidal rule is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_{\\rm trap} =  h \\left( \\frac{y_0 + y_{n-1}}{2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-2} y_i \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is in fact nearly identical to the simple sum, except that instead of using the first point and skipping the last point, we replace the first point with average of the first and last points. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Simpson's rule\n",
    "\n",
    "While the trapezoidal rule is clearly much better, we can do even better if we use a quadratic interpolation instead of a linear interpolation between the points. This technique is known as Simpson's rule: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the estimate of the integral is given by a more complicated sum involving different coefficients for the odd and even points:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_{\\rm simp} = \\frac{h}{3}\\left( y_0 + 2\\sum_{i=1}^{n/2-1}y_{2i} + 4\\sum_{i=1}^{n/2}y_{2i-1} + y_n \\right)\n",
