    "# Jupyter Notebooks and Python Basics\n",

    "Welcome to Computational Science, welcome to Python programming! In this course, you will implement various basic programming techniques in Python and apply them to solving physics problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you will use Python using a platform called \"Jupyter Notebooks\". Jupyter notebooks are a way to combine formatted text (like the text you are reading now), Python code (which you will use below), and the result of your code and calculations all in one place. Go through the notebooks and run the examples. Try to understand their functioning and, if necessary, add code (such as print statements or variable overviews) to make it clear for you. In addition, there are exercises and practice cells where you can program for yourself. Don't be afraid to start coding yourself, writing code and making mistakes is the best way to learn Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, you will learn the basic concepts of programming in Python. To get started, we will first explain the basic concepts of what python is and how it works. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning objectives for this notebook:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Student is able to start the python interpreter and run code in a notebook\n",
    "* Student can stop and start notebook kernels\n",
    "* Student is able to create variables\n",
    "* Student can use `%whos` to list the variables stored in the memory of the python kernel\n",
    "* Student is able to determine the type of a variable \n",
    "* Student is able to convert between different variable types (float, int, etc)\n",
    "* Student is able to collect user input using the `input()` command\n",

    "Python is an (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language>interpreted</a>) computer programming language. Using python, you can ask your computer to do specific things, like perform a calculation, draw a graph, load data from a file, or interact with the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you run Python, either by running it on the command line, or by running it in a Jupyter notebook like you are now, a Python **\"kernel\"** is created. This kernel is a copy of the Python program (\"interpreter\") that runs continuously on your computer (until you stop it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a way to interact with the Python kernel. Notebooks are divided up into \"cells\", which can be either a text (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>markdown</a> format) cell, like this one, or a code cell (containing your code), like the cell below it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The selected cell is surrounded by a box. If you type \"enter\" in a text cell you can start editing the cell. If you push \"Run\" above, or type \"Shift-Enter\", the code will be \"run\". If it is a code cell, it will run a command (see below). If it is a markdown cell, it will \"compile\" the markdown text language into formatted (HTML) text. \n",
    "\n",
