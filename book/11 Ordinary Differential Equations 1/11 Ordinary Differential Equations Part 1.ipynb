A  example of a problem in physics that is described by a first-order ODE is the charging of a capacitor through a resistor (an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_circuit>RC circuit</a>):\n",

For this, you need first to find the current flowing through the resistor, as this will determine the charge on the capacitor, since by Kirchoff's laws, the charge has nowhere else to go.

    "\n",
    "As you may have noticed, although Euler integration seems to work pretty well for the RC circuit, it fails very badly for the Harmonic oscillator! The undamped harmonic oscillator is an example of a *stiff* equation which is numerically unstable for some type of solver algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is that extrapolation of the derivative is a very poor approximation: so much so that it requires a very small time step to prevent the solution of the simple harmonic oscillator from diverging! Euler's method is particularly bad with so-called \"stiff\" equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "An improvement over the Euler method is to include a more accurate estimate of the derivative of the function defining the derivatives. Doing this in successive higher orders is called the Runge-Kutta (RK) technique:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of RK2 is that numerical derivatives give a much better estimate of the slope at the midpoint between two points rather than at the point itself (see also the lecture notebook for lecture 4). \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using the value of the derivative at time $t$ to predict the value of the function at the next time step $t+\\Delta t$, RK2 uses instead the value of the derivative at a time half-way to the next time step, $t + \\Delta t /2$ to extrapolate. Just like how the center-based difference gives a more accuarte estimate of the slope, this will also give a more accurate extrapolation of the value of the function at the next time step. To determine the value at $t + \\Delta t/2$, we use the Euler method. \n",

But instead of updating $x$ based on this alone, we use this to get a better estimate of the slope by moving a half step in $x$ and a half step in $t$ and use this to calculate the second order RK coefficient, which is an improved estimate of the actual $\\Delta x$: \n",

    "In the above, we have implemented directly the Euler and Runge-Kutta methods of numerical integration with our own python code. Doing so, we have learned insight into how these techniques work and when and how things can go wrong! As we saw, the code is very simple (only a few lines) and using this code, we can directly solve relatively complex numerical problems in physics!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to coding the numerical integration routines yourself, the `scipy` package also has built-in routines for numerical integration of ODEs. In particular, here, we will learn how to use the `solve_ipv()` routine:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html#scipy.integrate.solve_ivp\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading the documentation page, you can see that the `solve_ivp()` routine takes several variables and has many optional parameters, some of which you can likely now understand having solved the problems yourself above. The parameter `method` controls which technique is used for the numerical integration: by default, it uses a variant of RK4. The scipy numerical integration routines also support some additional routines, such as the BDF method:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_differentiation_formula\n",
    "\n",
    "which is more robust for integrating stiff differential equations like the undamped Harmonic oscillator. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use it\n",
    "\n",
    "The `solve_ivp()` routine returns not just the solution to the differential equation, but in fact a object that contains more information inside it about the numerical integration process itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "The routine is also smart enough to implement automatic choices of the step size, in which the step size is adapted based on estimations of what will make the integration as efficient as possible! While very cool, this means that by default, the resulting calculation will not be sampled equidistantly in time, as our examples above. Fortunately, the routine provides an optional argument `t_eval`, which is a numpy array of times that should be used for evaluating the solution that it returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercises, we will explore how the `solve_ivp()` routine works and how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 7:** Use the `solve_ivp()` routine to solve the problem of the charging capacitor above from Exercise 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to define a function `dVdt(t,V)`. By convention, this function should take time (the independent variable) as its first argument and the voltage value as it's second.  This function you will need to give as first argument of the `solve_ivp()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to pass a <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences>tuple</a> as the second argument of `solve_ivp()` to specify the start and end times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will need to give `solve_ivp()` the initial value of the voltage in the third argument. Since `solve_ivp()` is capable of solving multidimensional simultaneous equations, and also higher order ODEs, this argument must be a list of initial values, one for each of the 1st order ODEs it is solving. Although the problem we are considering of the RC circuit is only a single first-order ODE, we still have to make our initial condition into an array (for example, a numpy array of size `(1,)`). For this case, you can provide a list with one element: `[V0]`, where `V0` is the value $V(t=0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot your solution using points in your plot so that you can see the time steps that the routine chose for you automatically. Also, plot on top of the points you get the answer you had from exercise 6 in which you solve with RK4 with 1000 points."

    "## Second order ODEs with `solve_ivp()`\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve a second order ODE with `solve_ivp()`, or to solve more generally a set of coupled ODEs, one needs to be a bit clever with the definition of the derivative function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simple Harmonic oscillator example that we did above, we defined two derivative functions, one for each one of the (coupled) differential equations. We also had two separate variables we were keeping track of: one for `x` and one for `v`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the `solve_ivp()` routine, this works a bit differently. As we saw above, it works with a variable named `y` for the dependent variable when solving a 1st order ODE. \n",
    "\n",
    "When solving multiple coupled ODEs, instead of adding more separate variables, the `solve_ivp()` routine turns `y` into an array! This way, a single routine can solve as many coupled ODEs as you like!\n",
    "\n",
    "How do figure out what you put into the `y` variable array? You can choose! In this notebook, I will choose that `y[0]` corresponds to $x$ of my harmonic oscillator, and `y[1]` corresponds to $v$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other tricky thing is that your function `dydt(t,y)` that defines the derivative needs to now define _all_ of the derivatives in one function. The way this works is that you function gets passed both the independent variable `t` and the variable `y`, that is an array of all the dependent variables, and your function needs to return an array `yprime` which is the derivative in time of all the corresponding variables in the array: if `y[0]` is $x$, then `yprime[0]` is $dx/dt$, if `y[1]` is $v$, then `yprime[1]` is $dv/dt$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 9:** Use `solve_ivp()` to solve the problem of exercise 3. Use the same sampling in time for your answer as specified in exercise 3 by choosing the appropriate `t_eval`. Make two plots, one showing the resulting solution with your answer from your own RK2 code from exercise 5, and a second plot showing the difference between the two."
