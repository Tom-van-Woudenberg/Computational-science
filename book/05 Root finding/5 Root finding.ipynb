    "# Root finding\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture you will implement two techniques to determine the root of a non-linear function of one variable. The root of a linear functions can be solved analytically. For non-linear functions (e.g. sin$x = x/2$) this is sometimes possible, but in the most general case it is hard to write down a simple solution (sometimes a series expansions give you an analytical answer, but still this would require a computer to calculate it with the appropriate accuracy for you). In these cases you need a computer to do the job for you. In this notebook we will show you two methods that can be implemented to find the roots of a function of one variable, i.e., $f(x)=0$. In general, the sought solution can be multi-dimensional, which makes it more difficult to solve, but also similar methods can be implemented in that case. Root solving methods also can be used for finding the extrema of a function. Instead of solving for the roots of $f(x)$, solving the roots the derivative $f′(x)$ function, yields the local or global extrema of the function $f(x)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method\">bisection method</a> is a simple algorithm that iteratively ’traps’ the root of a function in an ever smaller interval. The bisection method is initiated by choosing two values $a$ and $b$ on the $x$-axis in which the to-be-determined root $f(x) = 0$ is located. By definition, the root is in an interval if there is a sign change in the function, i.e. either $f(a) > 0$ and $f(b) < 0$ or $f(a) < 0$ and $f(b) > 0$ (the product $f(a) \\cdot f(b)$ is always negative). The bisection methods works in the following way\n",
    "* Determine the initial interval $[a, b]$ enclosing the root, you can do this by plotting the function and determine an approximate interval.\n",
    "* Calculate the midpoint of the interval\n",
    "* Check in which interval the root is located, again by looking at the sign change over both intervals,\n",
    "* Set the new interval equal to the interval in which the root is located and set the error for the root as half the length of the interval, i.e. $(b − a)/2$. \n",
    "* When the error is larger than the sought for tolerance then continue with a new bisection, else exit and return the center of the interval in which the root is located. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note however, that the absolute error on the root cannot be calculated since the value of the root is not known a priori. The best estimate of the error is the size in which the root is located. The bisection method always yields an answer if the root is in the interval $[a, b]$. The bisection method is robust, but the convergence rate of the bisection method is slow.\n",
