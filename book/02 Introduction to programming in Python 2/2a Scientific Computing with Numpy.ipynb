    "Why is numpy so much faster? The reason is that Python is an <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language>interpreted language</a>. In each of the steps of the `for` loop, the Python kernel reads in the next step it has to do, translates that into an instruction for your computer processor, asks the computer to perform the step, gets the result back, reads in the next step, translates that into a processor instruction, sends that as an instruction to the computer processor, etc, etc. \n",

    "If we did the same test in a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language>compiled programing language</a> like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>C</a>, there would be no difference if we used a library function or if we wrote our own `for` loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you use smart functions in Python libraries, like (many of) those in numpy, numpy will actually use an external library compiled in a language like C or Fortran that is able to send all of the calculation in one step to your computer processor, and in one step, get all the data back. This makes Python nearly as fast as a compiled language like C or Fortran, as long as you are smart in how you use it and avoid having \"manual\" `for` loops for large or long calculations. \n",
