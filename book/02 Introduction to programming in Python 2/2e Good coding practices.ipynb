    "Once you become an expert at coding, it will become very easy to write code that python can understand.\n",

    "You might think: but I'm writing this code only for myself, so I don't really care about if my code is easy to understand, right? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons why this is incorrect: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. In this course, your teachers and your TAs will need to understand your code in order to grade it. If we can't quickly understand what you have done, **this will affect your grade!!!** (One of our grading criteria will be the clarity and readability of your code.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You might, in the future, want to share your code with someone else. If they have to spend a lot of time figuring out what you've done, then your code is useless to them. (In fact, this is the power of open languages like python, and is why python is so fantastically successful: there is a huge amount of code that other people have written that you can reuse!)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Weeks, months, or even years later, you might want to go back and re-use your own code. If your code not written in a clear and understandable way, you yourself will waste a lot of time trying to figure out what you did!\n",
    "\n",
    "In preparing the lecture notebooks for this course, I personally experienced 3 myself: I went back to some simple code that I wrote a few weeks earlier, and I realized I had no idea what the code did!\n",
