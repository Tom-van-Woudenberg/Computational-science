Usually, we say that a computer program is an  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm>*algorithm*</a>, i.e., it is \"a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation\". In order to develop these codes computer scientists use what is called algorithmic thinking. In essence, algorithmic thinking is the process of solving a problem in a systematic way.

    "## Designing algorithms\n",

    "\n",
    "Although this may seem a trivial task, algorithmic thinking can improve the rapid and correct implementation of this problem in computer code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Understanding the problem and abstract\n",
    "The first thing we do is to define more precisely what is required. The data file can be obtained from <a href=\"http://projects.knmi.nl/klimatologie/daggegevens/selectie.cgi\">KNMI</a> but is given to you as `KNMI_20200129.txt`. First open the file in a text editor.\n",
    "* The file has a header and the data consists of three columns\n",
    "* The temperature column consists of daily temperature readings in units of 0.1 degrees\n",
    "* Summer period is defined as a temperature in excess of 25 degrees Celcius\n",
    "* There are probably many summer periods, so we have to compare their lengths\n",
    "* We output the length of the summer period and the start date\n",
    "* We are not sure whether there are any summer periods in the data set\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined the problem a bit better we can describe in words what we have to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop over all days in the data set. If the temperature of the day is higher than or equal to 25 degrees, add 1 day to the summer day length, and go to the next day. When encountering the first day with a temperature lower than 25 degrees, compare the calculated number of consecutive summer days, if the period is longer than the previous longest summer period, replace both the start date and the summer period length by the new start date and length. Set the length back to zero.\n",

In this way we know that if programming errors occur we know at which step they occur, which makes it more easy to solve them. Below is a first outline of our program.

    "The reason why `np.average` is so much faster is that this is a pre-compiled function: it already knows that it will be repeating the same thing over and over again and can load this all in one go into your process. For that reason, it is hundreds of times faster than using a `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, in general, if you have python code that is using a `for` loop and you care about how fast it runs, it's always a good idea to check if there is a built-in function from python that can do it for you. Very often, there is, and for this reason well-written python code can often be just as fast as FORTRAN or C. The flip side of the coin is that when you are learning to program, it is always important to write out these things first with your own (slow) `for` loops so that you understand how the algorithm works."

You can start by looking for a peak: for each step you take, if the next point is “higher” then the previous one, it becomes your candidate for where the peak is. As long as the next point keeps going up, then the position of the peak keeps moving with you.
