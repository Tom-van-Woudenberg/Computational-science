    "### Loading data\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we might have just a small number of data points that we have measured by hand and wrote down on a piece of paper: say a list of measured fall times for different heights. In this case, you can just \"load\" the data by just defining Python arrays that contain your measured values:\n",
    "\n",

    "# Drop heights in meters\n",
    "d = np.array([0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 , 2.0,  2.5]) \n",

    "t = np.array([0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.44, 0.6, 0.89])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In a computer controlled experiment, though, you may have, for example, a data file of voltage measured as a function of time from an acquisition card or oscilloscope which may have hundreds, thousands, or even millions of data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically (if you're lucky), the measurement software will save its data in an (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII>ASCII</a>) text file. (Or at least there will be software for converting the data to an ASCII text file...) For example, let's think about an experiment where we measure a voltage as a function of time. In this case, the data will often be recorded in two columns of numbers in the text file, separated by a space. The first number would represent the time of the measurement, say in seconds, and the second the measured voltage, in volts:\n",
