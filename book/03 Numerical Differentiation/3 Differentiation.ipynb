    "## Finite difference methods for calculating derivatives of functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin with considering calculating the numerical derivatives of functions, specifically using the technique of finite differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, the derivative we want to calculate might be the derivative of a functions that we have an analytical expression for, such as $f(x) = ax^2$. In contrast to analytical integration, which can sometimes be challenging to perform and find a closed solution for, taking derivatives of functions is in general not so difficult (you likely learned this in your first calculus course!). For example, the derivative of $f(x)$ above is simply $f'(x) = 2ax$. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask: if it is always possible to analytically calculate the derivative of a function, why would I bother calculating the derivative with a computer? Some quick answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is handy \n",
    "* Sometimes you don't know the function\n",
    "* Finite difference is a key concept in solving many numerical problems\n",
    "\n",
    "A first reason is that it is just handy sometimes to calculate the derivative numerically, it saves you time in having to calculate the analytical derivative by hand. For example, later, when we solve differential equations, we will use code routines from libraries to get solutions, and then it is handy for us if we only need to provide the function, and not it's derivatives. The same is true for curve fitting: curve fitting routines also use derivatives of the fitting functions, which they calculate numerically so that the user using them doesn't have to think about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second reason is that in a computer program, you can implement functions that are not necessarily simple analytical formulas. For example, $f(x)$ in a computer could return the result of a numerical simulation. Or it could be a random number. Or it could be a piecewise function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def my_funny_function(x):\n",
    "    if (x<0):\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return x**2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we calculate the calculate the derivative of `my_funny_function(x)` numerically, then I don't even need to know what happens inside of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a third important reasons is that the concept of finite difference methods for calculating derivatives also forms the basis of important numerical algorithms used for solving equations in physics, such as Maxwells equtions, the Schroedinger equation, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of finite difference methods\n",
    "\n",
    "All finite difference methods are based on approximating a derivative of a function at a point by the slope of a line connecting two points separated by a distance $h$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{df}{dx} \\approx \n",
    "\\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is illustrated in this image from wikipedia, where the formula above calculates the *secant*: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=300 src=\"resource/asnlib/public/541px-Derivative.svg.png\"></img> \n",
    "\n",
    "The approximation becomes exact in the limit $\\Delta x \\rightarrow 0$, but in a computer we will work with a non-zero $\\Delta x$. A subtle point of the above equation is: to which point $x$ do we assign the value of $df/dx$ from this formula? Do we choose it to be the value of the derivative at $x$? Or the value at $x = x+h$? Or somewhere in between?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, people distinguish three different common choices for this: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Backward difference** Approximates that the secant is the derivative in the right side of the plot $df/dx = f'(x+h)$\n",
    "* **Forward difference** Approximates that the secant is the derivative at the left side of the above plot: $df/dx = f'(x)$\n",
    "* **Center difference** Approximates that the secant is the derivative in the middle of the plot $df/dx = f'(x+h/2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the specific example above, we can see that the secant will over-estimate the derivative at position $x$ (the secant is steeper than the slope of the function at that point): this means that the forward difference approximation will overestimate the derivative in this case. Conversely, in the example above, the secant will underestimate the slope of the function at $x+h$, and so the backwards difference will underestimate the derivative in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explain the terminology further, it is useful to remember that the forward difference uses a point in *front* of where we are (at larger x) to estimate the derivative, the backwards derivative uses a point *behind* where we are to estimate the derivative, and the center difference uses equally spaced points forward and backwards to estimate the derivative. These three are illustrated here for estimating the derivative at a position $x_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img width=90% src=\"resource/asnlib/public/finite_difference.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "And, as you can already maybe guess looking at these two examples, the center difference gives the most accurate approximation of the derivative $df/dx$ at position $x_0$, something we will explore below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of the three techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "Having explored the basic ideas above, we give here the formal definitions of the three techniques. The forward difference as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f'_F(x,h) = \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The backward difference is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f'_B(x,h) = \\frac{f(x) - f(x-h)}{h}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the center difference as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f'_C(x,h) = \\frac{f(x+h/2) - f(x-h/2)}{h}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Order of the errors made\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a Taylor expansion, one can also estimate the errors made in the above approximations of the derivative (see for example the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference#Relation_with_derivatives>wikipedia page</a>).\n",
    "\n",
    "The forward difference approximation result in an error $\\epsilon_F = f'_F(x,h) - f'(x)$ that is *first order* in $h$, ie. proportional to $h$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon_F \\propto h |f''(x)| \\hspace{1em} {\\rm as}\\  h \\rightarrow 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f''(x)$ is the second derivative of the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common notation for this in computer science big-O notation, which is used to define the asymptotic limits of functions. Basically, $ = \\mathcal{O}(h)$ means the same thing as $\\propto h$, and in words we would read this as \"the error is order h\". We can then write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon_F = \\mathcal{O}(h) \\hspace{1em} {\\rm as}\\  h \\rightarrow 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the error for the backwards difference is also $\\mathcal O(h)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon_B = \\mathcal{O}(h) \\hspace{1em} {\\rm as}\\  h \\rightarrow 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The center difference is actually more accurate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon_C = \\mathcal{O}(h^2) \\hspace{1em} {\\rm as}\\  h \\rightarrow 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often used for this reason, although can suffer from problems with periodic function (see wikipedia page if you are interested in learning more).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher order approximations of derivatives \n",
    "\n",
    "If one would like to have a more accurate estimate of the derivative without taking a smaller value of $h$, one can also use higher order approximations of the derivative: for example, the following forward difference approximation is a more complicated formula: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{df}{dx} \\approx \\frac{f(x+2h)-4f(x+h)+3f(x)}{2h}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "but gives an error order $\\mathcal O(h^2)$. (This forms the basis of the Runge-Kutta techniques for solving differential equations that we will look at later in the course.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher order derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "One can also extend the above techniques to calculate second-order derivatives (or even higher if needed). For example, in the center difference approximation,  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} \\approx \\frac{f(x+h)-2f(x)+f(x-h)}{h^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is a formula we will use later when we are solving the Poisson equation. "

Let's look at an explicit example. Say we have a data set of 5 points corresponding to voltages measured at 5 different times:\n",
