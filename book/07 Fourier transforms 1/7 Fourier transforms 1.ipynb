    "### Review of the Fourier Series\n",
    "\n",
    "A powerful and frequently used tool in computational science is the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The DFT can be thought of as the digital analog of the conventional Fourier transform:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform\n",
    "\n",
    "For a function defined from $t=0$ to $t=T$, one can express that function mathematically with a Fourier series:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y(t) = \\sum_{\\omega=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\tilde y_\\omega \\exp \\left( i\\omega t \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a continuous function $y(t)$, the coefficients $\\tilde y_\\omega$ are given by the following integral:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tilde y_\\omega = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T y(t) \\exp \\left( - i \\omega t\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete Fourier Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "For the case that $y(t)$ is a continuous function, I need an infinite number of Fourier coefficients $\\tilde y_\\omega$. When working with Fourier transforms in Python, we will consider instead a function that is sampled at discrete points with a spacing $\\Delta t$. In this case, our function $y(t)$ is actually an array of values `y[i]`, accompanied by a time vector `t[i]`. In this case, we can transform the integral in the equation for $\\tilde y_\\omega$ into a sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tilde y_\\omega = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} y_i \\exp \\left( i \\omega t_i \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_i$ is the value of element `y[i]` of the array of the data that we are taking the Fourier transform of. In general, if you start with $N$ elements in your sampled function $y(t_i)$, then your Fourier transform $\\tilde y_\\omega$ will also be a vector of $N$ (complex valued) elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Fast Fourier Transform \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons for the prevalence of the Fourier transform in computational science is that there is a trick that makes it's calculation extremely computationally efficient! As you can see above, computing all of the $N$ elements of your array $f_k$ requires adding up $N$ elements from your initial vector $f(t_n)$. In total, if you did this as I just described using two nested `for` loops, it would require $N^2$ operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that some smart people (including Gauss in 1805) discovered that if you are smart about how you calculate the Fourier transform, you can perform the calculation in $N\\log N$ steps. The algorithm is called the Fast Fourier Transform. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it called \"Fast\"? For $N=10^6$, the difference between $N^2$ and $N\\log N$ is a big deal!! Say your calculation with the FFT takes 1 second. To perform the same calculation with a nested `for` loop would take $10^6$ seconds = 11 days. 1 second vs 11 days is a big deal! And it only gets worse: for $N=10^9$, the same hypothetical FFT would take 1000 seconds (16 minutes) vs 31 years!\n",
    "\n",
    "In section 7.4, the textbook goes into quite some detail about how the FFT works, but we will be primarily interested in exploring how to use the FFT in this lecture. Fortunately, `numpy` provides a wide range of functions for working with FFTs:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.fft.html\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other types of (related) Fourier Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the complex-valued transform described above, there are several of different types of closely related Fourier-type transforms:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Fourier-related_transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "Including the discrete sine transform (DST):\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_sine_transform\n",
    "\n",
    "and the discrete cosine transform (DCT):\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the DFT, the DCT, and the DST is the type of boundary condition that is applied at the edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "* DFT: applies periodic boundary conditions on your array of data\n",
    "* DST: Applies the boundary condition that the values are zero at the edges of the array\n",
    "* DCT: Applies the boundary condition that the slope of your data at the edges of the array is zero\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data naturally satisfies one of these boundary conditions, then it can be advantageous to pick the transform that matches your expected data boundary behaviour, as this will minimize the artifacts that arise from the application of the transform to your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, though, as long as you are aware of these boundary conditions and any artifacts that may arise from them, then it is also fine to use any of the transforms with your data. "

    "\n",
    "We will start by looking at a function $y(t) = \\sin(\\omega t)$, which should have a pretty simple Fourier transform! In principle, the Fourier transform of a sinusoidal function should be just a delta-function peak, and so we will expect that we should get a Fourier transform $\\tilde y_\\omega$ that has just one entry that is not zero.

    "\n",
    "Before I reveal the function that can calculate the frequency axis for you, there are two important concepts in understanding frequencies in the discrete Fourier transform:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Nyquist frequency**\n",
    "2. **The spectral resolution**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Nyquist frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is the \"maximum\" frequency that one can define for a time-sampled function (also known as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency>Nyquist frequency</a>). To understand where the Nyquist frequency comes from, it is useful to take a look a what happens when you \"sample\" an oscillating signal. For this, I will consider a sine wave that is sampled at a 1 Hz sampling frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "For low enough frequencies, we can nicely see the shape of the sine wave:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=resource/asnlib/public/sampling1.png></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "For a higher freuquency sine wave, it looks less \"pretty\", but you can still see that the signal is oscillating:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=resource/asnlib/public/sampling2.png></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the **highest** frequency that you can still see oscillations in for a 1 Hz sampling rate? To know that a signal is oscillating, it should go up and down. If the first point is up, the second point should be down, and then the third point should be up again. If the points are spaced by 1 second, we need at least a two second period (one up, one down). **The Nyquist frequency for a 1 Hz sampling rate is therefore 0.5 Hz!** And it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=resource/asnlib/public/sampling3.png></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we sample a faster frequency sine wave? If we pick a 1 Hz sine wave sampled at 1 Hz, we cannot distinguish this from just a constant voltage!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=resource/asnlib/public/sampling4.png></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "Something even more intersting happens if we pick something a bit different from 1 Hz. For example, if we look at a 1.1 Hz sine wave sampled at 1 Hz, it actually looks identical to if we had sampled a 0.11 Hz sine wave!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=resource/asnlib/public/sampling5.png></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon is known as frequency folding or aliasing, and it is something that you may see sometimes when you are working with a digital oscilloscope.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Spectral resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Nyquist frequency determines the _fastest_ frequency that we can observe in our discrete Fourier transform. But what sets the _lowest_ frequency? \n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to observe that something is periodic and oscillating, we need to be able to observe one period of oscillation. For a time trace of total length $T$, this then sets our frequency resolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta f = \\frac{1}{T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This determines not only what the lowest frequency is we can observe, but also the maximum accuracy with which one can distinguish two signals that are oscillating at nearly the same frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Nyquist frequency and Spectral Resolution \n",
    "\n",
    "With $f_s$ = Sampling frequency and $T$ = Total time of trace, the two important numbers are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nyquist Frequency:** $f_n = f_s/2$  = Maximum frequency in your FFT\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Spectral resolution:** $\\Delta f = 1/T$ = Spacing between points in your FFT\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important that you know and understand these concepts! \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, though, there is also a function build into numpy for this called <a href=https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.fft.fftfreq.html#numpy.fft.fftfreq>fftfreq()</a> that can automatically generate an appropriate vector representing the frequency axis of your FFT. To use it, you need to tell it the number of points in the array you transformed, and the spacing in time between the time points. \n",
    "\n",
    "For your trace, because we have been careful to use the `np.arange()` function, the spacing between the points is exactly `1/fs`. If you did not know for sure, you could also take `dt = t[1]-t[0]`.\n",
