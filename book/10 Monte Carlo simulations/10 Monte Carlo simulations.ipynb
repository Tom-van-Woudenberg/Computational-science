The Ising model is a model of this process in which the individual moments are represented by dipoles or spins arranged on a grid or lattice, illustrated here:\n",

Then the actual energy of interaction is $-J_{ij} s_i s_j$, where $J_{ij}$ is a positive interaction constant. The minus sign ensures that the interactions are ferromagnetic, meaning the energy is lower when dipoles are lined up. A ferromagnetic interaction implies that the material will magnetize if given the chance.  (In some materials the interaction has the opposite sign so that the dipoles prefer to be antialigned.
