In this case, the units of the axis of your Fourier transform is not frequency, but instead a two-dimensional <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_vector>wave vector</a>, usually denoted by letter $k$, with units of inverse distance m$^{-1}$. For a 2D FT, the wave vector is a two-dimensional vector $\\bf{k}$ with vector components $k_x$ and $k_y$.\n",

    "Note that as long as the assumptions above hold, the image of the diffraction pattern on the screen is independent of the wavelength: changing from a green to red laser pointer, for example, changes only the size / scaling of the image (the dots on the wall will be further apart for a green laser than a red one). \n",
